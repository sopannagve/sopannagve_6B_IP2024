   <h2 class= "topic"> Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC)</h2>

<p>To meet the positioning, navigation and timing requirements of the nation, ISRO has established a regional navigation satellite system called Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC). NavIC was erstwhile known as Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).</p>

<p>NavIC is designed with a constellation of 7 satellites and a network of ground stations operating 24 x 7. Three satellites of the constellation are placed in geostationary orbit, at 32.5°E, 83°E and 129.5°E respectively, and four satellites are placed in inclined geosynchronous orbit with equatorial crossing of 55°E and 111.75°E respectively, with inclination of 29° (two satellites in each plane). The ground network consists of control centre, precise timing facility, range and integrity monitoring stations, two-way ranging stations, etc.</p>

<br><h2 class= "topic">NavIC offers two services:</h2></br><p>Standard Position Service (SPS) for civilian users and Restricted Service (RS) for strategic users. These two services are provided in both L5 (1176.45 MHz) and S band (2498.028 MHz). NavIC coverage area includes India and a region up to 1500 km beyond Indian boundary. NavIC signals are designed to provide user position accuracy better than 20m (2) and timing accuracy better than 50ns (2).NavIC SPS signals are interoperable with the other global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals namely GPS, Glonass, Galileo and BeiDou</p>

 <h2 class= "topic">How INSAT (Indian Satellite) System Helps In Weather Analysis?</h2>
<br><mark>Sophisticated Imaging Technology:</mark></br> INSAT satellites such as 3D and 3DR are equipped with RGB imagers, which play a crucial role in identifying various meteorological phenomena. They do this by analysing solar reflectance and brightness temperature across different wavelengths.
<br><mark>Geostationary Orbit Positioning:</mark></br> Positioned in geostationary orbits, INSAT 3D and 3DR consistently cover the Indian region, providing vital, continuous weather monitoring.
<br><mark>Round-the-Clock Weather Tracking:</mark></br> These satellites feature ‘day microphysics’ and ‘night microphysics’ capabilities, enabling them to track weather changes throughout the day and night for more thorough surveillance.
<br><mark>Distinguishing Snow and Clouds:</mark></br> INSAT satellites are adept at differentiating between snow and clouds based on their specific spectral reflectance, which is key for precise weather forecasting.
<br><mark>Improved Weather Forecasting Accuracy:</mark></br> Utilising both daytime and nighttime data, these satellites aid in better tracking of cyclones and thunderstorms, thereby improving early warning systems.
<br><mark>Enhanced Radiometer Features:</mark></br> Newer satellites like INSAT 3DR are equipped with upgraded radiometers, offering higher spatial resolution and better functionality than earlier versions like Kalpana 1 and INSAT 3A.
<br><mark>Detailed Atmospheric Analysis:</mark></br> The atmospheric sounders on these satellites measure temperature, humidity, and water vapour levels, providing comprehensive atmospheric profiles crucial for weather analysis.
<br><mark>Technological Advancements in New Satellites:</mark></br> Each new satellite in the INSAT series, including INSAT 3DR, comes with advanced features like an improved VHRR, sounder, and additional transponders, continually enhancing India’s weather monitoring capabilities.

<h2 class="topic">Disaster Management Support<h2>

<p>India is prone to many natural disasters like floods, landslides, cyclones, forest fires, earthquakes, drought, etc. Satellites provide synoptic observations of the natural disasters at regular intervals that helps in better planning and management of disasters. In order to better understand the risks due to such disasters, it is necessary to integrate satellite and field based observations and to work towards risk reduction principles. Satellite communication and navigation systems also play an important role in disaster management with improved technological options.</p>

<p>Disaster Management Support (DMS) Programme, comprehensively addresses various aspects of natural disasters in the country, using space based inputs. ISRO disseminates relevant information in interactive geo-spatial domain through various geoportals like Bhuvan, National Database for Emergency Management and MOSDAC for the administrators to better understand the impact and for improved decision support.</p>

<p>ISRO provides the satellite based near real time information support to Central Ministries / Departments and State Ministries / Departments, prior during and after major natural disasters. In addition, ISRO also provides capacity building in use of Space technology inputs in Disaster Management Support.</p>

<p>ISRO is actively involved with various other countries with regard to disaster management, through international frameworks, such as, International Charter ‘Space & Major Disasters’, Sentinel Asia, UNESCAP and so on.</p>
